PMC6268051,"3.2. Synthesis (E)-3-Phenylpropyl-3-(3,4-Diacetoxyphenyl)acrylate (4). A mixture of diacetylcaffeic acid (2, 300 mg, 1.13 mmol), thionyl chloride (5 mL) and two drops of DMF was heated at reflux for 4 h. The excess thionyl chloride (SOCl2) was removed on a rotovap, and the residue was dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (4 mL). To this solution was slowly added pyridine (1 mL) and 3-phenylpropan-1-ol (232.0 μL, 1.71 mmol, 1.3 eq.). The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After removal of solvents, the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (25 mL), the organic extract was washed with water (2 × 20 mL), brine (2 × 20 mL), and then dried over MgSO4. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel circular chromatography using 5–15% EtOAc-hex to afford 314 mg (yield = 73%) of the desired derivative 4 as a white solid.

Synthesis of 3-Oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic Acid (3) The synthesis of 3-oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic acid (3) was described elsewhere [17], but is summarized here for convenience. Briefly, ethanol (85 mL), Meldrum’s acid (6.5 g, 45 mmol), 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (7.75 g, 45 mmol), and a catalytic amount of pyridine (0.5 mL) were in sequence added into a 100 mL flask. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into an ice-water bath and recrystallized. The crude was washed with ethanol repeatedly and dried in vacuo to afford the desired product 3-oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic acid (3) as a yellow solid (Yield: 93.1%).
