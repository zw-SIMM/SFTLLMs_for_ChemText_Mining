The reaction mixture was heated to 60 °C to give a homogeneous solution that was maintained at 60 °C for 16 hours at which time the starting material was completely consumed.
To the residue were added ethyl acetate (3 ml) and heptane (3 ml) to precipitate a solid.
To a stirred solution of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-[3-fluoro-4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole (0.15 g, 0.324 mmol) in DME (3.9 mL) was added furan -3-boronic acid (0.044 g, 0.389 mmol), bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium( II)chloride (0.025 g, 0.04 mmol) and saturated NaHCO3 solution (1.3 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen.
Yield 1.5 g (50.34%).
Appl. (1992), GB 2253848 A1 was reacted with [2-methyl-5-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]-methanol (example 11 d]) in the presence of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl azodicarboxamide and tributylphosphine to give [rac]-2-{6-[2-methyl-5-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-2H-pyrazol-3-ylmethoxy]-indol-1-yl}-propionic acid-ethyl ester as colorless oil.
Potassium hydroxide (3.65 g, 65.1 mmol) is added all at once to a suspension of 4-bromo-3-methyl-1-(4-methylbenzenesulphonyl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile (4.66 g, 13.7 mmol) in methanol (95 mL) cooled using an ice bath.
The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 hours, and then 300 ml of water was added.
The reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for 92 hours and the mixture was poured into 2M aqueous hydrochloric acid (85ml) then diluted with water (170ml).
Without further workup, the mixture is purified directly by preparative HPLC [Method 10].
The reaction vessel is sealed and the solution is left to stir for 20 h. EtOAc (50 mL) is added.
