        "paragraph": "Optimized Reaction Conditions for Zr-CAU-28. In the system ZrOCl2·8H2O/H2FDC/2-propanol/acetic acid, the initial synthesis conditions were optimized. Subsequently, it was observed that 2-propanol can be readily replaced by equal volumes of water, water/2-propanol, and water/ethanol mixtures, respectively. While Zr-CAU-28 is always obtained (Figure 2), this affects the particle diameter as observed by dynamic light scattering (see Supporting Information, SI, Table S1 and Figures S1, S2). The optimized reaction system is ZrOCl2·8H2O/H2FDC/H2O/acetic acid. The most crystalline product is obtained by a microwave-assisted reaction of a mixture of 45 mg (0.28 mmol) of H2FDC, 60 mg (0.19 mmol) ZrOCl2·8H2O, 700 μL acetic acid, and 800 μL H2O. The reaction mixture was stirred for several minutes before being placed into the microwave oven at 80 °C for 1 h. The raw product was separated via centrifugation and washed in ethanol by redispersion and centrifugation. Yield: 55 mg (46% based on H2FDC) of a white crystalline powder of [Zr6O4(OH)4(FDC)4(OH)4(H2O)4]·nH2O with n ≈ 16 (elemental analysis measured: C: 16.71; H: 2.26; calculated: C: 16.72; H: 3.90).Figure 2Figure 2.

In an ambient condition, Py-PTP (25 mg, 0.023 mmol), benzoic acid (1 g, 8.92 mmol)were added into a 6-dram vial. 20 mL of DMF is then added and the vial was sonicated to fully dissolve the reagents. Then, ZrOCl2·8H2O (10 mg, 0.03 mmol) was quickly weighed into the vial containing the reagents, and the vial was sonicated again until no solid can be found in the vial. The solution prepared was divided into two portions, which is achieved by transferring half of the solution into an empty 6-dram vial by pipet. The 2 vials prepared were heated in a heating block on a hotplate, and the temperature of the heating block is set at 120 °C by using thermocouple. After 24 hours, vials were taken out from the heating block, and the mother solution was removed by centrifuging (10 mins, 7000 rpm). The crystalline powder obtained was washed with DMF three times over the course of 24 h, and centrifugation is used to separate liquid from the solid every time. Solid collected from 3 vials were combined and transferred into an 8-dram vial in solvated form. 30 mL of DMF was then added and the vial was heated at 100 °C for 16 h. Using centrifugation, solution part was discarded and the solid was washed with DMF twice over 8 hours. Then, absolute ethanol was used to do solvent exchange. Fresh ethanol was used to exchange the solvent for three times over three days. This sample was subjected to supercritical carbon dioxide drying reported in previous paper. Liquid CO2 was used to exchange the ethanol, the system was vented 4 times over the course of 10 hours to fully exchange the ethanol with CO2. The system was then bleeded at the rate of 0.2 cc/s.Subsequently the samples were dried on an activation port of an ASAP 2020 under dynamic vacuum at 120 °C until an outgassing rate of ≤ 0.002 mm Hg min-1was reached. The yield from 8 vials is ~50 mg.To get single crystal of NU-1103 for single crystal X-Ray determination, another synthesis procedure were used to obtain large single crystals. ZrOCl2 (3 mg, 0.01 mmol) and benzoic acid (400 mg, 3.57 mmol) is weighed in a 6-dram vial. DEF (3 mL) is added and the solution is sonicated to afford a suspension. Heat this mixture in 80 °C oven for 2h, and then add 2 mL solution of 12 (Py-PTP)(concentration: 5 mg/mL). The reaction vial is placed in a 100 °C oven for 24 h and the mother solution is exchanged with fresh DMF. The resulting cubic crystals are formed with a secondphase.",

A typical synthesis of ZrSQU is performed in an 11 mL borosilicate glass reactor wherein 0.24 mmol (56 mg) ZrCl4 is dissolved in a mixture of 64 mmol (5 mL) of N,N dimethylformamide (DMF) and 70 mmol (4 mL) of acetic acid (AA). To this solution 0.72 mmol (82 mg) of SQA is added together with 12 mmol of HCl (1 ml HCl 37%). The molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/AA equals 1/3/50/174/267/292. This mixture is reacted at 383 K for 2-3 h, after which a white precipitate has formed (92 % yield based on Zr). The as-synthesized material is separated by centrifugation and washed several times with DMF and acetone followed by a drying step in air at 333 K for 24 h. Replacing ZrCl4 with HfCl4 enables the formation of the isostructural hafnium squarate. The use of a monocarboxylic modulator as well as HCl is required to obtain powder of sufficient crystallinity. ZrSQU can also be synthesized using formic acid (FA). In this case the optimal molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/FA is found to be 1/3/25/87/373/276. The synthesis and washing procedures are in each case identical as in the previously described method. In absence of modulator no product was formed.

To this solution 0.72 mmol (82 mg) of SQA is added together with 12 mmol of HCl (1 ml HCl 37%). The molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/AA equals 1/3/50/174/267/292. This mixture is reacted at 383 K for 2-3 h, after which a white precipitate has formed (92 % yield based on Zr). The as-synthesized material is separated by centrifugation and washed several times with DMF and acetone followed by a drying step in air at 333 K for 24 h. Replacing ZrCl4 with HfCl4 enables the formation of the isostructural hafnium squarate. The use of a monocarboxylic modulator as well as HCl is required to obtain powder of sufficient crystallinity. ZrSQU can also be synthesized using formic acid (FA). In this case the optimal molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/FA is found to be 1/3/25/87/373/276. The synthesis and washing procedures are in each case identical as in the previously described method. In absence of modulator no product was formed. Similarly, in absence of DMF no crystallization occurred due to the low solubility of squaric acid in the resulting synthesis solution.",

The temperature was kept at 100 °C for 48 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting solid was isolated by centrifugation, and washed with DMF and methanol repeatedly before being dried under vacuum. Yield: 15 mg (45%).",

The clear mixture was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, block crystals were formed. Particularly, NU-500 crystals were only formed under stringent reaction conditions. Although smaller NU-500 crystals formed when heated at 120 °C for 24 h, increasing the time to 48 h resulted in crystals that were more suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. However, longer heating times and varying the amount of formic acid both led to the crystallization of NU-1008 or mixed NU-600 and NU-1008 phases. Thus, no NU-500 powder could be formed, despite our efforts.After cooling down to room temperature, the generated crystals were collected by centrifugation and washed with N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL ×3) and acetone (5 mL×3).
