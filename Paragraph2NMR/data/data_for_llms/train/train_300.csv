Synthesis of 3-Oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic Acid (3) The synthesis of 3-oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic acid (3) was described elsewhere [17], but is summarized here for convenience. Briefly, ethanol (85 mL), Meldrum’s acid (6.5 g, 45 mmol), 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (7.75 g, 45 mmol), and a catalytic amount of pyridine (0.5 mL) were in sequence added into a 100 mL flask. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into an ice-water bath and recrystallized. The crude was washed with ethanol repeatedly and dried in vacuo to afford the desired product 3-oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic acid (3) as a yellow solid (Yield: 93.1%).

PMC10051936," By using FT-IR, 1H and 13C-NMR techniques, a characterization of the prepared benzoxazine monomer was conducted before curing. The condensation of eugenol and melamine and formaldehyde was used to synthesize EM-Bzo (Figure 1a). In the FT-IR spectrum (Figure 1b), EM-Bzo exhibits a characteristic peak at 939 cmâˆ’1, denoting oxazine ring structure at 1246 and 1022 cmâˆ’1 due to the asymmetric and symmetric vibration of Câ€“Oâ€“C, respectively. A band can be seen at 1142 cmâˆ’1 for the Câ€“Nâ€“C stretching vibrations, as well as a peak at 1372 cmâˆ’1 caused by tetra-substituted benzene [24]. Furthermore, methoxy carbonyl bound to the benzene ring exhibited symmetric and asymmetric vibrations at 1021 and 1247 cmâˆ’1, respectively. Moreover, eugenolâ€™s alkyl chain, as well as the methylene group of its benzoxazine ring, gave bands between 2976 and 2828 cmâˆ’1, respectively [25]. In addition to 1H-NMR analysis, 13C-NMR analysis provided further structural insight into the synthesized EM-Bz monomer. EM-Bz is a benzoxazine-containing eugenol and melamine that can be viewed simultaneously due to its specific chemical structure. The spectra of benzoxazine synthesized in Figure 1c can be seen in this figure. As a result, benzoxazine monomers exhibit proton resonances with two singlets of equal intensity. This is because of the presence of â€“CH2 protons, located at 4.5 and 5.2 ppm with respect to Nâ€“Câ€“Ar and Nâ€“Câ€“O, respectively. The â€“OCH3 protons produce a singlet at 3.8 ppm. The peaks at 3.2, 5.9 and 5.0 ppm can be ascribed to protons of allyl group. Between 6.5 to 7.5 ppm the aromatic rings contribute protons. Moreover, the 13C-NMR spectrum shown in Figure 1d shows a characteristic carbon resonance striking the oxazine ring at 49 ppm and 79 ppm, respectively. Aromatic carbons are all found between 110 and 150 ppm, with the peak at 56 ppm associated with â€“OCH3 carbon, apart from 116, 142 and 40.4 ppm being attributed to the allyl carbon [26]. ",,,,,,,,

Conclusions In this study, we successfully synthesized two conjugated microporous polymers, Py-BSU CMP and TBN-BSU CMP, using Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling of BSU-Br2 with Py-T and TBN-T, respectively. We characterized the chemical structures, physical properties, porosity, and morphology of these CMPs using various analytical techniques, including FTIR, solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, BET, SEM, and TEM. Both Py-BSU CMP and TBN-BSU CMP showed excellent thermal stability with Td10 up to 383 °C and char yield up to 48 wt% at 800 °C as measured by TGA. We also investigated the electrochemical performance of these CMPs and found that TBN-BSU CMP exhibited better performance due to its more extended π-conjugated system, higher specific surface area (391 m2 g−1), and total pore volume (0.30 cm3 g−1). Under the three-electrode measurement system, TBN-BSU CMP showed significantly better electrochemical performance with a capacitance of 70 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 compared to Py-BSU CMP. TBN-BSU CMP also demonstrated excellent stability with less capacitance decay (99.9%) in long-life-cycle energy storage devices. Finally, we believe that these BSU-linked CMPs, Py-BSU and TBN-BSU CMPs, hold great potential for other applications such as H2 production and gas conversion. Overall, our findings suggest that these CMPs could be attractive candidates for various energy storage and conversion applications.

This solution was then cooled to 0 °C and subsequently sparged with O2 for 10 min. The reaction was kept at 0 °C while ozone was then bubbled (2 L/min, 35% power). After stirring for 35 min, the reaction was deemed to be incomplete based on LCMS analysis and additional oxime (0.806 g, 4.50 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was added in a single portion to the reaction mixture. Ozone was bubbled through the reaction for another 60 min, at which point additional oxime (0.806 g, 4.50 mmol, 0.5 equiv) was added in a single portion to the reaction. The ozone power was increased to 40% and ozone addition was continued for another 80 min until the reaction was judged complete by TLC and HPLC analysis. The reaction mixture was then purged of ozone by bubbling with O2 for 10 min, followed argon gas for 10 min to remove dissolved oxygen.

[Ru(phen)2(Bndpa)](PF6)2 (2) was obtained as an orange solid with a yield of 26% (0.1 g, 0.10 mmol). Compound 2 was stored at room temperature, protected from light. Single crystals of 2, suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis, were obtained by slow diffusion of diethyl ether into a saturated solution of the ruthenium complex in acetonitrile.

The mixture was stirred and heated using microwave irradiation (60 °C, 60 W) for 5 min, and then 2-isocyano-1-morpholino-3-phenylpropan-1-one (1.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was added. The new mixture was stirred and again heated using microwave irradiation (70 °C, 150 W) for 25 min, and then maleic anhydride (1.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) was added. Finally, the reaction mixture was stirred and heated using microwave irradiation (80 °C, 150 W) for 20 min. Then, the solvent was removed to dryness under vacuum. The crude was extracted using ethyl acetate (3 × 10.0 mL) and Na2CO3(aq.) (3 × 10.0 mL), and then washed with brine (3 × 10 mL). The organic layer was dried using anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to dryness under vacuum.
