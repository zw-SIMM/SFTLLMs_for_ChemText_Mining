"Paragraph_2_solvent_volume:Green synthesis and structure determination. The green, high yield synthesis of the compound, [Al(C6H2O4S)(OH)].xH2O named CAU-23, was achieved by a reaction between AlCl3 and NaAlO2 as the metal sources, and sodium thiophenedicarbox ylate (Na2TDC) as the linker source. Upon mixing, a white X ray amorphous precipitate is formed which subsequentlycrystallizes under reflux conditions at ambient pressure. Thus4.30 g H2TDC (25 mmol) was mixed with 2.0 g (50 mmol)sodium hydroxide in 100 mL distilled water until a clear solu tion of Na2TDC was obtained. After adding 18.75 mL of aqu eous aluminum chloride solution (1 mol/L, 18.75 mmol), and 12.5 mL of aqueous sodium aluminate solution (0.5 mol/L, 6.25 mmol), the slurry was stirred under reflux conditions for 6 h,and then filtered off and dried at 100 °C for 4 h. Only an aqu eous sodium chloride solution is formed as the other reactionproduct. After an additional washing step with 200 mL waterunder stirring and reflux, filtration and drying, 4.5 g of a whitepowder was obtained (84% yield based on H2TDC).",Paragraph_2_solvent_volume,100 mL

The pH of the solution mixture was adjusted to ca. 5.4 by addition of acetic acid. The solution mixture was then introduced to a borosilicate glass tube. The tube was flash frozen at 77 K using a liquid N2 bath, evacuated for 15 min to remove oxygen, and then flame-sealed to maintain a oxygen-free environment inside the tube during the reaction process. After the sealed reaction tube was heated at 85 °C for 4 d, truncated colorless crystals were obtained. The crystals were subsequently collected and washed with DMF, water, and MeOH (3 × 2 mL, each) before SXRD analysis. For the activation procedure, as-synthesized ZIF-202 was washed five times with DMF per day (5 mL each), exchanged nine times with anhydrous MeOH (5 mL each) over the course of 3 d, and then activated at 80 °C under reduced pressure (1 mTorr) for 24 h.

Upon mixing, a white X ray amorphous precipitate is formed which subsequentlycrystallizes under reflux conditions at ambient pressure. Thus4.30 g H2TDC (25 mmol) was mixed with 2.0 g (50 mmol)sodium hydroxide in 100 mL distilled water until a clear solu tion of Na2TDC was obtained. After adding 18.75 mL of aqu eous aluminum chloride solution (1 mol/L, 18.75 mmol), and 12.5 mL of aqueous sodium aluminate solution (0.5 mol/L, 6.25 mmol), the slurry was stirred under reflux conditions for 6 h,and then filtered off and dried at 100 °C for 4 h. Only an aqu eous sodium chloride solution is formed as the other reactionproduct. After an additional washing step with 200 mL waterunder stirring and reflux, filtration and drying, 4.5 g of a whitepowder was obtained (84% yield based on H2TDC).",Paragraph_2_reaction_temperature,reflux

"Paragraph_2_reaction_time:Optimized Reaction Conditions for Zr-CAU-28. In the system ZrOCl2·8H2O/H2FDC/2-propanol/acetic acid, the initial synthesis conditions were optimized. Subsequently, it was observed that 2-propanol can be readily replaced by equal volumes of water, water/2-propanol, and water/ethanol mixtures, respectively. While Zr-CAU-28 is always obtained (Figure 2), this affects the particle diameter as observed by dynamic light scattering (see Supporting Information, SI, Table S1 and Figures S1, S2). The optimized reaction system is ZrOCl2·8H2O/H2FDC/H2O/acetic acid. The most crystalline product is obtained by a microwave-assisted reaction of a mixture of 45 mg (0.28 mmol) of H2FDC, 60 mg (0.19 mmol) ZrOCl2·8H2O, 700 μL acetic acid, and 800 μL H2O.

Many attempts at synthesizing the Mg version were carried out, but the conditions were not optimized to the same degree as the Zn version. Therefore, we chose to simply present the Zn version of IRMOF-74-VI. 120 mg of Zn(NO3)2·4H2O (0.403 mmol) and 79.0 mg of VI (0.114 mmol) were dissolved with 10 mL DMF in a 20 mL vial. The vial was sealed and sonicated for two hours to ensure maximum solubility of the linker, VI.
