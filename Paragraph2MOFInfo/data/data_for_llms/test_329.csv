"SynthesisAll chemicals used to synthesize ZrSQU and HfSQU were commercially obtained from ABCR and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. A typical synthesis of ZrSQU is performed in an 11 mL borosilicate glass reactor wherein 0.24 mmol (56 mg) ZrCl4 is dissolved in a mixture of 64 mmol (5 mL) of N,N dimethylformamide (DMF) and 70 mmol (4 mL) of acetic acid (AA). To this solution 0.72 mmol (82 mg) of SQA is added together with 12 mmol of HCl (1 ml HCl 37%). The molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/AA equals 1/3/50/174/267/292. This mixture is reacted at 383 K for 2-3 h, after which a white precipitate has formed (92 % yield based on Zr). The as-synthesized material is separated by centrifugation and washed several times with DMF and acetone followed by a drying step in air at 333 K for 24 h. Replacing ZrCl4 with HfCl4 enables the formation of the isostructural hafnium squarate. The use of a monocarboxylic modulator as well as HCl is required to obtain powder of sufficient crystallinity. ZrSQU can also be synthesized using formic acid (FA). In this case the optimal molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/FA is found to be 1/3/25/87/373/276. The synthesis and washing procedures are in each case identical as in the previously described method. In absence of modulator no product was formed. Similarly, in absence of DMF no crystallization occurred due to the low solubility of squaric acid in the resulting synthesis solution.","[{""compound name"": ""ZrSQU"", ""metal source"": ""ZrCl4"", ""metal amount"": ""56 mg, 0.24 mmol"", ""linker"": ""SQA"", ""linker amount"": ""82 mg, 0.72 mmol"", ""modulator"": ""HCl | acetic acid (AA)"", ""modulator amount or volume"": ""12 mmol, 1 mL HCl 37% | 4 mL, 70 mmol"", ""solvent"": ""N,N dimethylformamide (DMF)"", ""solvent volume"": ""5 mL, 64 mmol"", ""reaction temperature"": ""383 K"", ""reaction time"": ""2-3 h""}, {""compound name"": ""HfSQU"", ""metal source"": ""HfCl4"", ""metal amount"": ""NaN"", ""linker"": ""SQA"", ""linker amount"": ""NaN"", ""modulator"": ""HCl | acetic acid (AA)"", ""modulator amount or volume"": ""NaN"", ""solvent"": ""N,N dimethylformamide (DMF)"", ""solvent volume"": ""NaN"", ""reaction temperature"": ""NaN"", ""reaction time"": ""NaN""}, {""compound name"": ""ZrSQU"", ""metal source"": ""ZrCl4"", ""metal amount"": ""NaN"", ""linker"": ""SQA"", ""linker amount"": ""NaN"", ""modulator"": ""HCl | formic acid (FA)"", ""modulator amount or volume"": ""6 mmol"", ""solvent"": ""N,N dimethylformamide (DMF)"", ""solvent volume"": ""NaN"", ""reaction temperature"": ""NaN"", ""reaction time"": ""NaN""}]"

"Preparation of Cu3(BTC)2 and Guests. All chemicals wereobtained from Sigma-Aldrich at 99% purity. Liquid guests for vaporadsorption were purified overnight with molecular sieves and calciumchloride. Cu3(BTC)2(H2O)3·xH2O was synthesized by the addition of 0.700 mol of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O in 6 mL of H2O to 0.03510 mol ofH3BTC dispersed by sonication in 6 mL of ethanol. The mixture wasstirred for 20 min, transferred into a 20 mL Teflon insert, placed in aParr solvothermal bomb and heated to 95 °C for 18 h, and then cooledto room temperature over 8 h. Blue crystals were obtained by filtering,washing with deionized water, and air-drying. A single crystal wasisolated for the SCXRD experiments. The remaining crystals wereseparated from a secondary product by alternative washing andsonication in methanol, a process involving four repeats with twowashes performed at 50 °C. The product of pure blue crystals was air dried and used for gravimetric vapor adsorption measurements.","[{""compound name"": ""Cu3(BTC)2"", ""metal source"": ""Cu(NO3)2·6H2O"", ""metal amount"": ""0.700 mol"", ""linker"": ""H3BTC"", ""linker amount"": ""0.03510 mol"", ""modulator"": ""NaN"", ""modulator amount or volume"": ""NaN"", ""solvent"": ""H2O | ethanol"", ""solvent volume"": ""6 mL | 6 mL"", ""reaction temperature"": ""95 °C"", ""reaction time"": ""18 h""}]"
"Sample Preparation. [Al(OH)(bdc)]·0.70(H2bdc) was synthe sized by following the procedure reported previously.16 Al(NO3)3·9H2O (5.2 g) was dissolved in deionized water (20 mL) followed byaddition of H2bdc (1.112 g) to the mixture which was then placed intoa 40 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.
