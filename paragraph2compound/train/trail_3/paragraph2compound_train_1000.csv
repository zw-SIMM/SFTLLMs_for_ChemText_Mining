The resulting solution of acetic acid 3-chlorocarbonyl-2-methyl-phenyl ester was cooled to 10° C., and was then added to the (2S,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyric acid mixture while maintaining the temperature <10° C. during addition. The resulting biphasic mixture was agitated at 5° C. for 1 h, and was then adjusted to pH 2.5-3.0 with concentrated HCl (62 kg). The mixture was then warmed to 25° C., and the layers were separated. The resulting THF fraction, containing (2S,3S)-3-(3-acetoxy-2-methyl-benzoylamino)-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyric acid, was partially concentrated by distillation at one atmosphere. THF was then replaced with ethyl acetate by distillation at one atmosphere, while maintaining a minimum pot volume of 1500 L. The resulting solution was cooled to 25° C., and was then charged with acetic anhydride (74.8 kg, 733 mol) and methanesulfonic acid (10.8 kg, 112 mol). The mixture was heated at 70° C. for approximately 3 h. The mixture was cooled to 25° C., and was then quenched with H2O (1320 L) while maintaining the temperature at 20° C. After removal of the aqueous layer, the organic fraction was charged with ethyl acetate (658 L) and H2O (563 L). After agitation, the aqueous phase was removed. The organic fraction was washed twice with 13 wt. % aqueous NaCl (2×650 L). The organic fraction was partially concentrated and dried by vacuum distillation (70-140 mm Hg) to a volume of approximately 1500 L. The resulting solution was heated to 40° C., and was then charged with n-heptane (1042 L) while maintaining the temperature at 40° C. The solution was seeded with (2S,3S)-2-acetoxy-3-(3-acetoxy-2-methyl-benzoylamino)4-phenyl-butyric acid (0.1 kg), and additional n-heptane (437 L) was then added slowly. The crystallizing mixture was maintained at 40° C. for 1 h. Additional n-heptane (175 L) was added while maintaining the temperature at 40° C. The crystalline suspension was cooled and held at 25° C. for 1 h, then at 0° C. for 2 h. The suspension was filtered, using n-heptane for rinsing. The wet cake was dried under vacuum at 55° C. to give 174 kg (74.5%) of (2S,3S)-2-acetoxy-3-(3-acetoxy-2-methyl-benzoylamino)-4-phenyl-butyric acid as a white solid: m.p.=152-154° C.; 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.21-7.35 (m, 5H), 7.13 (app t, J=7.9 Hz, 1H), 7.01 (app d, J=8.1 Hz, 1H), 6.94 (app d, J=7.2 Hz, 1H), 5.99 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1H), 5.33 (d, J=4.1 Hz, 1H), 4.96-5.07 (m, 1H), 3.07 (dd, J=5.5, 14.6 Hz, 1H), 2.90 (dd, J=10.0, 14.5 Hz, 1H), 2.30 (s, 3H), 2.18 (s, 3H), 1.96 (s, 3H); 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCl3) δ 170.4, 170.2, 169.6, 169.5, 149.5, 137.81, 136.5, 129.2, 128.6, 128.4, 127.0, 126.6, 124.5, 123.7, 73.1, 50.9, 35.9, 20.6, 20.5, 12.4; elemental analysis calcd for C22H23NO7: C, 63.92; H, 5.61; N, 3.39; found: C, 64.22; H, 5.68; N, 3.33; MS (CI) m/z 414.1572 (414.1553 calcd for C22H24NO7, M+H+).","(2S,3S)-3-Amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyric acid | NaCl | THF | NEt3 | H2O | Acetic acid 3-chlorocarbonyl-2-methyl-phenyl ester | THF | acetic acid 3-chlorocarbonyl-2-methyl-phenyl ester | (2S,3S)-3-amino-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyric acid | HCl | THF | (2S,3S)-3-(3-acetoxy-2-methyl-benzoylamino)-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-butyric acid | THF | ethyl acetate | acetic anhydride | methanesulfonic acid | H2O | ethyl acetate | H2O | NaCl | n-heptane | n-heptane | (2S,3S)-2-acetoxy-3-(3-acetoxy-2-methyl-benzoylamino)-4-phenyl-butyric acid"

US08957103B2,"An indole glyoxyl ester is reacted with a phenyl acetamide derivative in a one-pot reaction in an inert solvent in the presence of a strong base. Preferably an ether is used as an inert solvent, such as tetrahydrofurane or dioxane. As a base potassium tert.-butoxide can for example be used. The water formed during the reaction is removed, for example by using a molecular sieve. The phenyl acetamides used as starting material are readily available from the corresponding acetic acids which are converted to the acid chloride and hydrolyzed with ammonia. The indole glyoxyl esters (R=methyl, ethyl) can be synthesized by Friedel-Crafts-type acylation of the corresponding indole derivative with methyl or ethyl oxalyl chloride, cf. Tetrahedron 1999, 55 (43), 12577-12594. The corresponding azaindole glyoxyl esters can be prepared according to the method reported in J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67: 6226-6227 or by Friedel-Crafts acylation in the presence of aluminum chloride, cf. Organic Letters (2000) vol. 2, no. 10, 1485-1487.
