Preparation of Ionic Liquids With diethylene glycol-bridged functionalized imidazolium dicationic ionic liquids as an example, synthesis route of polyethylene glycol-bridged functionalized imidazolium dicationic ionic liquids was shown in four steps as follows: Firstly, thionyl chloride was added to diethylene glycol in anhydrous environment and then heated to 250°C until no starting material was observed using TLC. And then, it was cooled and extracted with CHCl2. The extract was washed with water, saturated NaHCO3 solution, and saturated NaCl solution. The product is dried under reduced pressure. Secondly, N-methylimidazole was added to the above dichlorodiglycol in methanol at room temperature. The reaction continued for 24 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a viscous gum and soluble in water and in methanol. The obtained dichloride salt was used directly, without further purification. Then, the obtained dichloride salt was dissolved in methanol, and then, KPF6 was added with rapid stirring. After four hours, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was washed by water and filtrated to collect the solid. The solid was recrystallized in acetone and the colorless crystal generated, named IL-1 and 2IL-2.

All calculations were carried out to Gaussians default criteria, with all optimized geometries showing no negative frequencies to ensure a minimum, rather than a saddle point, had been found. For solvent calculations the integral equation formalism Polarizable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM) [63,64] was used with Gaussian’s predefined definitions of the solvents. TD-DFT calculations were performed to the 30th state using the TD keyword in Gaussian to implement TD-DFT as defined within the Gaussian program [65], for solvent calculations the solvent molecule were not equilibrated. The calculations were performed using New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI, Auckand, New Zealand). The vibrational frequencies and orbitals were visualized using Molden [66] and GaussView 05W [67] (Gaussian Inc.) respectively. A scaling factor of between 0.94 and 0.97 was applied to the vibrational frequencies to account for anharmonicity, the values used are consistent with those determined in the literature [33,68]. The calculated normal Raman spectra were modelled for a 1064 nm excitation wavelength [53]. This uses the equation: [/INST],\n",

Minimalist linker 17 (19 mg, 75 μmol, 1.53 eq) in THF (0.5 mL) was added, followed by anhydrous K2CO3 (13.5 mg, 98 μmol, 2 eq), and DMF (0.5 mL). The reaction was purged with Ar again, allowed to come to rt, then warmed to 30°C, and stirred for 22 h. Upon completion, H2O (10 mL) was added, and the reaction was transferred to a separating funnel. The aqueous layer was extracted with CHCl3 (2×10 mL), and the combined organic layer was washed with brine (10 mL), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated. The crude silyl ether was subsequently dissolved in THF (0.5 mL) and transferred to a 10 mL round bottom flask, purged with Ar, and cooled to 0°C in an ice water bath. 1 M TBAF in THF (98 μL, 98 μmol, 2 eq) was added, and the reaction stirred for 15 min at 0°C. Upon completion, the reaction was quenched with H2O (10 mL), and transferred to a separating funnel. The aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (10 mL) and the organic layer washed with brine (10 mL), dried over MgSO4, and concentrated.

When partially dissolved, an ice water bath was placed under the reaction flask and 0.093 g (2.46 mmol) of NaBH4 was added slowly in small portions. The ice water bath was removed and the solution was allowed to stir at room temperature (24°C) for 3 hours. The reaction was monitored by TLC (7:3 ethyl acetate/hexane) and it resulted in two spots with corresponding Rf values of 0.73 and 0.77. The reaction mixture was placed in an ice water bath and 15 mL of chilled 5% HCl was added very slowly. The crude reaction mixture was poured onto 10 mL water, separated, extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 15 mL) and dried over MgSO4. Using a Whatman #1 filter pad, the reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent was removed in vacuo resulting in a clear oil with 66.7% yield.

Sodium 2,2-dichloro-2-(trifluoromethoxy)acetate (4, 59 mg, 0.25 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added to a solution of triphenylphosphine (79 mg, 0.30 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and iodine (76 mg, 0.30 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL). After 30 min of stirring, a solution of p-anisidine (46 mg, 0.38 mmol, 1.5 equiv) and triethylamine (53 µL, 0.38 mmol, 1.5 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (1 mL) was transferred via cannula in the reaction mixture at room temperature, which was further stirred for 16 h. Water (10 mL) and CH2Cl2 (5 mL) were then added and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 15 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum.
