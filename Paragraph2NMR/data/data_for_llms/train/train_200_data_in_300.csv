Then, the resulting solution was refluxed for 1 h, and ClP(OEt)2 (1.56 g, 10 mmol) in 5 mL of Et2O was added dropwise with cooling in an ice bath.

L-Selectride (1 M in THF, 42 mmol, 1.20 eq; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis MO, USA) was added over 1 h, and the mixture was stirred an additional 5 min.

The resulting mixture was diluted with brine (500 mL) and the products were extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried, concentrated, and purified by vacuum flash chromatography (5% - 25% EtOAc/Hexanes).

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield). A solution of NaH (1.43 mmol) and 9 (0.33 g, 1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) at room temperature was stirred for 1 h and then cooled to 5–7 °C. The ethyl bromoacetate (0.43 g, 2.6 mmol) was added to the resulting mixture and continuously stirred at room temperature for 20 h. After completion of the reaction (TLC), the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (15 mL). The resulting precipitates were filtered off, dried, and then extracted with chloroform.
