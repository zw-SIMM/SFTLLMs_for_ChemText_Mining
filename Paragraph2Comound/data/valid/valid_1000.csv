Succinic anhydride (645 mg, 6.45 mmol) and catalytic amount of DMAP was added to the reaction mixture to form clear solution. The reaction mixture was flushed with argon and allowed to stir under argon atmosphere for 12 h. Then, pyridine was removed under vacuum and the crude residue was diluted in 30 ml DCM. It was washed with 1N HCl (30 ml) and water (30 ml). The organic layer was separated and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by performing a TLC in 1:99 Methanol:DCM solvent mixture. The product was used for next step without further purification. PI-103 (25 mg, 0.072 mmol) was dissolved in 3 ml anhydrous DCM followed by addition of cholesterol-succinic acid (0.216 mmol, 105 mg), EDC (0.216 mmol, 41.4 mg) and DMAP (0.216, 26 mg).

The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme and continued for 15 minutes at 30° C. The reaction was stopped by heating the reaction mixture at 100° C. for 2 minutes. The amount of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline formed in the reaction mixture was determined by the pre-column derivatization method. One hundred microliter of 0.3M boric acid buffer (pH 10.7), 4 μl of aqueous solution of 10% (v/v) mercaptoethanol and 16 μl of ethanol solution of 5% (w/v) OPA were added to 100 μl of the reaction mixture, and the mixture was allowed to stand at 60° C. for 30 seconds.
