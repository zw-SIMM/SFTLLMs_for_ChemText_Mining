To a stirred solution of (3Z,4Z)-furan-2,3,4(5H)-trione 3,4-dioxime (3.0 g, 0.021 mol) in 1,4-dioxane (21 mL) under nitrogen, thionyl chloride (2.1 mL, 0.029 mol) was added dropwise. The resulting yellow solution was stirred overnight and then concentrated in vacuo. The resultant crystalline material was recrystallized once from a minimum amount of ethanol (EtOH) to give the desired compound as an off-white powder. The filtrate was concentrated down and recrystallized again. Combined solids yielded the desired product (2.0 g, 76%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ: 5.67 (s, 2H).
