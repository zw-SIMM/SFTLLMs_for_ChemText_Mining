      "Prompt: <s>[INST] Extract the MOF synthesis information from the Paragraph. SynthesisAll chemicals used to synthesize ZrSQU and HfSQU were commercially obtained from ABCR and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. A typical synthesis of ZrSQU is performed in an 11 mL borosilicate glass reactor wherein 0.24 mmol (56 mg) ZrCl4 is dissolved in a mixture of 64 mmol (5 mL) of N,N dimethylformamide (DMF) and 70 mmol (4 mL) of acetic acid (AA). To this solution 0.72 mmol (82 mg) of SQA is added together with 12 mmol of HCl (1 ml HCl 37%). The molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/AA equals 1/3/50/174/267/292. This mixture is reacted at 383 K for 2-3 h, after which a white precipitate has formed (92 % yield based on Zr). The as-synthesized material is separated by centrifugation and washed several times with DMF and acetone followed by a drying step in air at 333 K for 24 h. Replacing ZrCl4 with HfCl4 enables the formation of the isostructural hafnium squarate. The use of a monocarboxylic modulator as well as HCl is required to obtain powder of sufficient crystallinity. ZrSQU can also be synthesized using formic acid (FA). In this case the optimal molar ratio ZrCl4/SQA/HCl/H2O/DMF/FA is found to be 1/3/25/87/373/276. The synthesis and washing procedures are in each case identical as in the previously described method. In absence of modulator no product was formed. Similarly, in absence of DMF no crystallization occurred due to the low solubility of squaric acid in the resulting synthesis solution. [/INST],\n",

The clear mixture was sealed and heated at 120 °C for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, block crystals were formed. Particularly, NU-500 crystals were only formed under stringent reaction conditions. Although smaller NU-500 crystals formed when heated at 120 °C for 24 h, increasing the time to 48 h resulted in crystals that were more suitable for single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. However, longer heating times and varying the amount of formic acid both led to the crystallization of NU-1008 or mixed NU-600 and NU-1008 phases. Thus, no NU-500 powder could be formed, despite our efforts.After cooling down to room temperature, the generated crystals were collected by centrifugation and washed with N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL ×3) and acetone (5 mL×3). The crystals were then soaked in acetone overnight and washed with acetone for another three times.
