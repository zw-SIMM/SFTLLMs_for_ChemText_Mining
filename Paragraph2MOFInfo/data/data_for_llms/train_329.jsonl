The 2 vials prepared were heated in a heating block on a hotplate, and the temperature of the heating block is set at 120 °C by using thermocouple. After 24 hours, vials were taken out from the heating block, and the mother solution was removed by centrifuging (10 mins, 7000 rpm). The crystalline powder obtained was washed with DMF three times over the course of 24 h, and centrifugation is used to separate liquid from the solid every time.

Liquid CO2 was used to exchange the ethanol, the system was vented 4 times over the course of 10 hours to fully exchange the ethanol with CO2.

Heat this mixture in 80 °C oven for 2h, and then add 2 mL solution of 12 (Py-PTP)(concentration: 5 mg/mL). The reaction vial is placed in a 100 °C oven for 24 h and the mother solution is exchanged with fresh DMF.

The clear solution was incubated in an oven at 80 °C for 1h. After cooling down to room temperature, Por-PTP (12 mg, 0.01 mmol) was added to this solution and theresulting mixture was sonicated for 10 min. The dark purple solution was heated in an oven at 120 °C for 48 h. After cooling down to room temperature, dark purple cubic shaped crystals were separated from amorphous phase by centrifuging in DMF.Approximately 25 mg of solvated crystalline material was placed in a 4-dram vial with 3 mL of DMF. Then a solution of NiCl2·H2O (30 mg) in DMF (1 mL) was added and the vial was swirled gently and placed in an oven at 90 °C for 2 days to metallate the porphyrin core. After cooling down to room temperature the mother liquor was replaced with fresh DMF and the crystals were soaked in DMF overnight to remove unreacted salts. The material was then removed from DMF and soaked in absolute ethanol to exchange the solvent. Fresh ethanol was used for three times over three days to exchange DMF. The sample was then desolvated using the supercritical carbon dioxide method as described above. Finally the sample was outgassed on an activation port of an ASAP 2020 under dynamic vacuum at room temperature until an outgassing rate of ≤ 0.002 mm Hg min-1 was reached.
