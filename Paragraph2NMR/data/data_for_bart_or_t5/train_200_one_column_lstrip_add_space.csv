In a 100 mL flask, NaOH (4.6 g, 115 mmol) was added to a solution of octafluoropentanol (24.37 g, 110 mmol) and terabutyl ammonium bromide (0.1 g, 0.312 mmol) in toluene (50 mL). After stirring for 30 min at room temperature, epichlorohydrin (4.63 g, 50 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL toluene was added dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred at 73 °C for 12 h. When the starting materials disappeared upon inspection by TLC, the reaction mixture was washed with distilled water (50 mL × 3). The organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, followed by filtration and concentration under reduced pressure. After molecular distillation, a colorless and transparent liquid 2,3-Bisoctafluoropentyloxy-1-propanol (OFPA) (19.37 g) was obtained, with a yield of 74.5%. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) = 6.05 (2H, -CF2H), 4.01 (5H, -CH2-O-CH2-CHOH-CH2-O-CH2-), 3.70 (4H, -O-CH2-CHOH-CH2-O-), 2.33 (1H, -O-CH2-CH-CH2-O).13C NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm)= 68.04~68.38 (-O-CH2-CHOH-CH2-O-), 69.29 (-O-CH2-CHOH-CH2-O-), 73.41 (-O-CH2-CF2-), 105.93~117.04 (-CF2-CF2-CF2-CF2H). 19F NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3, ppm): δ = -120.00 (HF2CF2CF2CF2C-), -125.73 (HF2CF2CF2CF2C-), -130.39 (HF2CF2CF2CF2C-), -137.38 (HF2CF2CF2CF2C-).

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield). A solution of NaH (1.43 mmol) and 9 (0.33 g, 1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) at room temperature was stirred for 1 h and then cooled to 5–7 °C.

After completion of the reaction (TLC), the reaction mixture was poured into ice water (15 mL). The resulting precipitates were filtered off, dried, and then extracted with chloroform.

"Paragraph_2_1H_NMR_text: The following procedure was adapted from Kouklovsky et al. (1990). A dry flask flushed with Ar was charged with (1S)-camphorquinone (5.83 g, 35.1 mmol, 1 eq) and dry THF (200 mL), then cooled to −78 °C. L-Selectride (1 M in THF, 42 mmol, 1.20 eq; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis MO, USA) was added over 1 h, and the mixture was stirred an additional 5 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 3 M HCl in methanol (16 mL) over 10 min at −78 °C, then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting mixture was diluted with brine (500 mL) and the products were extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried, concentrated, and purified by vacuum flash chromatography (5% - 25% EtOAc/Hexanes). The fractions rich in the desired product were concentrated and subjected to flash column chromatography (20% EtOAc/Hexanes) to partially separate the isomers of hydroxycamphor. The resulting material was sublimed with a Kugelrohr distillation apparatus (55 °C, 0.1 Torr), yielding 397 mg (7%) of (1S)-exo-2, 92% isomerically pure (NMR).

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield).

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield).

"Paragraph_2_1H_NMR_data: The following procedure was adapted from Kouklovsky et al. (1990). A dry flask flushed with Ar was charged with (1S)-camphorquinone (5.83 g, 35.1 mmol, 1 eq) and dry THF (200 mL), then cooled to −78 °C. L-Selectride (1 M in THF, 42 mmol, 1.20 eq; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis MO, USA) was added over 1 h, and the mixture was stirred an additional 5 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 3 M HCl in methanol (16 mL) over 10 min at −78 °C, then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting mixture was diluted with brine (500 mL) and the products were extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried, concentrated, and purified by vacuum flash chromatography (5% - 25% EtOAc/Hexanes).

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield). A solution of NaH (1.43 mmol) and 9 (0.33 g, 1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) at room temperature was stirred for 1 h and then cooled to 5–7 °C.

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield). A solution of NaH (1.43 mmol) and 9 (0.33 g, 1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) at room temperature was stirred for 1 h and then cooled to 5–7 °C.

Then, the resulting solution was refluxed for 1 h, and ClP(OEt)2 (1.56 g, 10 mmol) in 5 mL of Et2O was added dropwise with cooling in an ice bath. The reaction was then continued for 8 h at room temperature, and the solution was once again cooled in an ice bath followed by the slow addition of 3 mL of a 30% aqueous solution of H2O2. When the addition was complete, the flask contents were poured onto 30 mL of water.

The resulting mixture was diluted with brine (500 mL) and the products were extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried, concentrated, and purified by vacuum flash chromatography (5% - 25% EtOAc/Hexanes).

The reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 12 h. Upon removal of the solvents under a vacuum, the residue was dissolved in 1 N NaOH solution (25 mL). The crude product was obtained by precipitation upon acidification of the filtrate with conc. HCl. After drying, the crude product was added to Eaton’s reagent (5 mL) at room temperature, then the mixture was heated to 90 °C for 1 h. The cooled reaction mixture was dropped into saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The precipitate was filtered to collect the rough product. Purification of the residue by silicagel column chromatography provided 9, a pale yellow solid (0.61 g, 37.7% yield). A solution of NaH (1.43 mmol) and 9 (0.33 g, 1.3 mmol) in DMF (5 mL) at room temperature was stirred for 1 h and then cooled to 5–7 °C.

"Paragraph_2_13C_NMR_data: N-phthaloylglycine chloride (1) was prepared by a slightly modified procedure [33] as follows: N-phthaloylglycine (2.052 g, 0.01 mol) was treated with an excess of SOCl2 (5.0 mL) in a moisture-free atmosphere. The resulting mixture was stirred until the evolution of gases ceased (about 3 h) and then allowed to stand overnight. The excessive thionyl chloride was then evaporated in a vacuum, and the solid residue was treated with hexane. Hexane was re-evaporated, and this process was repeated once more to remove trace amounts of SOCl2. The resulting white crystalline solid was filtered off and washed on a filter with petroleum ether, and dried in a vacuum to afford pure N-phthaloylglycine chloride PG-Cl.
