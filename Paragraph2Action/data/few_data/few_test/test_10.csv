Paragraph,Action
The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight.,STIR for overnight at room temperature.
"The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to yield 2.98 g of N-{2-[4-amino-7-[(6-aminohexyl)oxy]-2-(ethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]-1,1-dimethylethyl}-N-isopropylurea as a dark orange solid.","COLLECTLAYER organic; WASH with brine; DRYSOLUTION over sodium sulfate; FILTER keep filtrate; CONCENTRATE; YIELD N-{2-[4-amino-7-[(6-aminohexyl)oxy]-2-(ethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]-1,1-dimethylethyl}-N-isopropylurea (2.98 g)."
"3-Amino-2,4-dichloro-benzamide (2.00 g, 9.8 mmol) in THF (45 mL) was added dropwise to LiAlH4 (1 M in THF, 24.4 mL) in THF (45 mL).","ADD LiAlH4 ‌(1 M in THF) (24.4 mL); ADD THF (45 mL); MAKESOLUTION with 3-Amino-2,4-dichloro-benzamide (2.00 g, 9.8 mmol) and THF (45 mL); ADD SLN dropwise."
A further drop of methanesulfonyl chloride was added and the mixture continued to stir at RT for 30 min.,ADD methanesulfonyl chloride (1 drop); STIR for 30 min at RT.
"The reaction mixture was cooled to −80° C., and a solution of tert-butyl 6-[(cyclopropylmethoxy)methyl]-6-hydroxy-1,4-oxazepane-4-carboxylate (Preparation 80, 50 g, 0.22 mol, 1 eq) in THF was added.","SETTEMPERATURE −80° C; MAKESOLUTION with tert-butyl 6-[(cyclopropylmethoxy)methyl]-6-hydroxy-1,4-oxazepane-4-carboxylate (50 g, 0.22 mol, 1 eq) and THF; ADD SLN."
"After few hours, reaction mixture can be diluted with water and neutralize with hydrochloric acid, filter and recrystallize to give title compound.",WAIT for few hours; ADD water; PH with hydrochloric acid to pH neutral; FILTER; RECRYSTALLIZE from unknown; YIELD title compound.
The reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred over night.,STIR for over night at room temperature.
After the reaction is completed it was cooled to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate.,SETTEMPERATURE room temperature; EXTRACT with ethyl acetate.
"The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and ether and dried for 4 hours at 60° C. under high vacuum to give 7-benzyloxy-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one (7.02 g, 63%).","FILTER keep precipitate; WASH with water; WASH with ether; DRYSOLID for 4 hours at 60° C under vacuum; YIELD 7-benzyloxy-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one (7.02 g, 63%)."
"After concentration, the residue was diluted with dichloromethane (200 mL/mmol), washed with water (62 mL/mmol x 3).",CONCENTRATE; ADD dichloromethane (200 mL); WASH with water (62 mL) 3 x.
