PMC6008750,"2.4. Preparation of Ionic Liquids With diethylene glycol-bridged functionalized imidazolium dicationic ionic liquids as an example, synthesis route of polyethylene glycol-bridged functionalized imidazolium dicationic ionic liquids was shown in four steps as follows: Firstly, thionyl chloride was added to diethylene glycol in anhydrous environment and then heated to 250°C until no starting material was observed using TLC. And then, it was cooled and extracted with CHCl2. The extract was washed with water, saturated NaHCO3 solution, and saturated NaCl solution. The product is dried under reduced pressure. Secondly, N-methylimidazole was added to the above dichlorodiglycol in methanol at room temperature. The reaction continued for 24 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to yield a viscous gum and soluble in water and in methanol. The obtained dichloride salt was used directly, without further purification. Then, the obtained dichloride salt was dissolved in methanol, and then, KPF6 was added with rapid stirring. After four hours, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was washed by water and filtrated to collect the solid. The solid was recrystallized in acetone and the colorless crystal generated, named IL-1 and 2IL-2. For IL-1, the yield was 90%. m.p.: 91–93°C.

Computation Methods The compounds were modeled using Gaussian 09 D0.1 (Gaussian Inc, Wallingford, CT, USA) [61]. For all the calculations a 6-31G(d) basis set and a range of functionals, B3LYP [62] and CAM-B3LYP, were used. All calculations were carried out to Gaussians default criteria, with all optimized geometries showing no negative frequencies to ensure a minimum, rather than a saddle point, had been found. For solvent calculations the integral equation formalism Polarizable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM) [63,64] was used with Gaussian’s predefined definitions of the solvents. TD-DFT calculations were performed to the 30th state using the TD keyword in Gaussian to implement TD-DFT as defined within the Gaussian program [65], for solvent calculations the solvent molecule were not equilibrated. The calculations were performed using New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI, Auckand, New Zealand). The vibrational frequencies and orbitals were visualized using Molden [66] and GaussView 05W [67] (Gaussian Inc.) respectively. A scaling factor of between 0.94 and 0.97 was applied to the vibrational frequencies to account for anharmonicity, the values used are consistent with those determined in the literature [33,68]. The calculated normal Raman spectra were modelled for a 1064 nm excitation wavelength [53].

After completion of reaction (monitored by TLC), a cold saturated sodium thiosulfate solution (20 mL) was added and extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 25 mL); the combined organic layers were mixed with a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate and extracted to remove the unreacted starting material. The water layer was acidified with hydrochloric acid (10% aq) and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 25 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded 200 mg (94%) of the addition product. Thus, compounds were cooled down to 0 °C in an ice bath and 2.0 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid was added and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature for 2 h with continuous stirring. The reaction was quenched with ice and the mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 25 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with water, followed by saturated NaHCO3 solution.

After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was dissolved by adding ethyl acetate. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, and then washed twice with water and brine. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate, the combined organic layers were dried (magnesium sulfate), and the solvent was evaporated. Purification of the residue by column chromatography (silica gel, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 1% to 15% ethyl acetate) provided 1-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(2-nitrovinyl)benzene (791 mg, 4.09 mmol, 77%) as yellow crystals.

The reaction was warmed up to 60 °C and stirred at the same temperature for 2 h. After the reaction was complete, the mixture was cool to room temperature and evaporated with toluene (20 mL × 3). The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 mL) and washed successively with 2.0 M HCl aq. (200 mL), satd. NaHCO3 aq. (200 mL × 2), and brine (200 mL). The aqueous layers were back-extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL × 2). The combined extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered off, and concentrated in vacuo.

The reaction was conducted for 7 h. Then Na2SO3 (0.5 g) was added to destroy the unreacted HOCl and H2O2. The resulting mixture was acidified with 10.0% aqueous HCl to pH = 3.0, and extracted several times with diethyl ether. The separated organic phase was washed with saturated sodium bisulfite and deionized waters, respectively, and then dried over with anhydrous sodium sulfate, afterwards, it was distilled in warm bath to remove the ethyl ether, and later distilled in vacuum to provide 7.0 g of myrtenic acid as a colorless transparent viscous liquid, which was placed at room temperature to afford a colorless waxy solid.
