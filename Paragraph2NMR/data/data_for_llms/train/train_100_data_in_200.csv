Synthesis of 3-Oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic Acid (3) The synthesis of 3-oxo-3H-benzo[f]chromene-2-carboxylic acid (3) was described elsewhere [17], but is summarized here for convenience. Briefly, ethanol (85 mL), Meldrum’s acid (6.5 g, 45 mmol), 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (7.75 g, 45 mmol), and a catalytic amount of pyridine (0.5 mL) were in sequence added into a 100 mL flask. The mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 4 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into an ice-water bath and recrystallized.

PMC10102081," The following procedure was adapted from Kouklovsky et al. (1990). A dry flask flushed with Ar was charged with (1S)-camphorquinone (5.83 g, 35.1 mmol, 1 eq) and dry THF (200 mL), then cooled to −78 °C. L-Selectride (1 M in THF, 42 mmol, 1.20 eq; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis MO, USA) was added over 1 h, and the mixture was stirred an additional 5 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of 3 M HCl in methanol (16 mL) over 10 min at −78 °C, then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting mixture was diluted with brine (500 mL) and the products were extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried, concentrated, and purified by vacuum flash chromatography (5% - 25% EtOAc/Hexanes). The fractions rich in the desired product were concentrated and subjected to flash column chromatography (20% EtOAc/Hexanes) to partially separate the isomers of hydroxycamphor. The resulting material was sublimed with a Kugelrohr distillation apparatus (55 °C, 0.1 Torr), yielding 397 mg (7%) of (1S)-exo-2, 92% isomerically pure (NMR).

The reaction mixture was diluted in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and washed with 3 M aq. HCl (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer was then dried over MgSO4 and filtered. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Without further purification, the crude product was added to a mixture of acetonitrile (60 mL) and 3 M aq. HCl (30 mL). The resulting solution was stirred and refluxed for 1 hour, and then ethyl acetate (100 mL) and water (100 mL) were added. The organic layer was washed with 3 M aq. HCl (3 × 100 mL), dried over MgSO4, and filtered.
