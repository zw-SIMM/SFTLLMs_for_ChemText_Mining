The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight.
The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to yield 2.98 g of N-{2-[4-amino-7-[(6-aminohexyl)oxy]-2-(ethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl]-1,1-dimethylethyl}-N-isopropylurea as a dark orange solid.
3-Amino-2,4-dichloro-benzamide (2.00 g, 9.8 mmol) in THF (45 mL) was added dropwise to LiAlH4 (1 M in THF, 24.4 mL) in THF (45 mL).
A further drop of methanesulfonyl chloride was added and the mixture continued to stir at RT for 30 min.
The reaction mixture was cooled to −80° C., and a solution of tert-butyl 6-[(cyclopropylmethoxy)methyl]-6-hydroxy-1,4-oxazepane-4-carboxylate (Preparation 80, 50 g, 0.22 mol, 1 eq) in THF was added.
After few hours, reaction mixture can be diluted with water and neutralize with hydrochloric acid, filter and recrystallize to give title compound.
The reaction mixture was allowed to reach room temperature and stirred over night.
After the reaction is completed it was cooled to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate.
The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water and ether and dried for 4 hours at 60° C. under high vacuum to give 7-benzyloxy-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-4-one (7.02 g, 63%).
After concentration, the residue was diluted with dichloromethane (200 mL/mmol), washed with water (62 mL/mmol x 3).
